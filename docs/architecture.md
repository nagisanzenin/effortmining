# effortmining — Architecture

One page: what the components are, how data flows between them, and the one design decision everything hinges on (why tiered *agents* rather than a spawn-site effort knob).

## Why tiered agents (the load-bearing constraint)

effortmining exists to select reasoning effort **per subagent, by task difficulty**. The obvious way to do that would be to pass an `effort` argument when spawning each subagent, the way you can pass `model`. **That parameter does not exist.**

Verified against the installed Claude Code (`2.1.201`) binary and the official docs (`docs/research/01-mechanism-investigation.md`, `docs/research/01b-docs-verification.md`):

- The Agent/Task tool's input schema is `description, prompt, subagent_type, model, isolation, mode, name, run_in_background, team_name` — **no `effort`**. `model` is overridable per call; effort is not.
- A subagent's effort resolves as: **frontmatter `effort:` → else inherit the session effort.** There is no per-invocation override slot.
- So every ad-hoc subagent runs at the *session* effort. The only way to give one subagent a different, deliberate effort is to author a named agent with a static `effort:` in its frontmatter.

That constraint dictates the design. To offer five selectable effort tiers at dispatch time, effortmining ships **five otherwise-identical worker agents**, one per tier, differing only in `effort:`. Choosing a tier means choosing which agent to spawn. The five workers (`miner-low` through `miner-max`) are byte-identical in body — a fact the build verifies — so the *only* variable between them is reasoning effort, which is exactly what the calibration measures.

(Where a runtime exposes a real per-agent effort dial, for example Codex's `model_reasoning_effort`, the same tier abstraction maps onto it directly. On Claude Code today, tiered agents are the mechanism.)

- **`skills/effortmine`** — the user-facing orchestrator. Decomposes a request, classifies each subtask into one of four difficulty classes (T1-mechanical through T4-hard-reasoning), reads the calibration table, and dispatches each subtask to the `miner-<tier>` the table recommends. Logs every dispatch.
- **`skills/effort-bench`** — a thin driver over the benchmark harness. Runs the gated pipeline `validate → run → grade → analyze → report`, plus the runtime `calibrate` refit. Computes nothing itself.
- **`agents/miner-*`** — five tier-pinned generic workers. Do exactly the delegated subtask, return the raw result, no scope creep.
- **`agents/effort-grader`** — the blind grader. Grades an artifact against a task plus rubric with **no** field naming the tier/agent that produced it, so the grade cannot be biased by effort. Pinned to `medium` (one tier below the workers) to avoid grader-effort confounds. Used for non-deterministic tasks and runtime audit.
- **`bench/effort.py`** *(owned by the harness engineer)* — the deterministic, stdlib-only source of truth. Every pass rate, token count, and tier decision comes from here; the model shells out. `state/calibration.json` is its fitted output and `/effortmine`'s input.
- **`hooks/`** — ambient, safe telemetry. `session-start.sh` prints one status line when a table exists (silent otherwise). `log-dispatch.sh` appends one record per subagent dispatch, fail-open.

## Data flow — the calibration loop

```

Two things produce the log the loop feeds on: the `PostToolUse(Task)` hook records **every** dispatch automatically (the tier is derivable from the `miner-<tier>` agent name), and the `/effortmine` skill adds the semantic **task-class** label the hook cannot know. `calibrate` refits from the accumulated outcomes, guarded exactly like engram's FSRS refit (sample-gated at >= 9 per cell, clamped, single-step, human-readable diff) so a noisy handful of records cannot thrash the table.

## The oracle discipline (why the grader is blind)

The calibration is only as trustworthy as its grades. If the grader could see that an artifact came from `miner-low` versus `miner-max`, that label would leak into the grade and the whole table would be biased toward whatever the grader expected each tier to produce. So blindness is enforced by the **shape of the grader's input** — the payload has no tier/agent/model field — not by asking the grader to be fair. This is the independent-assessor pattern transposed from engram (`docs/research/03-pattern-mining.md`, A4), and it satisfies the loop-protocol rule that the producer of work must never control the check that judges it. For the pilot, every task uses a deterministic executable checker (an even stronger Tier-1 oracle), so the blind grader is specced and wired but not yet exercised.

## Provenance

Every structural choice traces to a mined pattern, documented in `docs/research/03-pattern-mining.md`: plugin manifest plus single-source version (A1), ambient silent-unless-useful hook plus injection guard (A2), deterministic CLI as source of truth (A3), the blind assessor (A4), guarded refit (A5), mode-classified orchestration (B1), the oracle-loop rulebook (B2), and receipt/effort telemetry (B3). The mechanism facts (no per-spawn effort parameter; effort inherits the session) are established in `docs/research/01-mechanism-investigation.md` and verified against the docs in `docs/research/01b-docs-verification.md`.
